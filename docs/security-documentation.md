# Security Documentation and Best Practices

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the AI Actor Generator application to protect user data and ensure secure operation.

## Authentication Security

### Implementation Details
- Firebase Authentication is used for secure user management
- Email/password authentication with strong password requirements
- HTTPS-only access enforced for all authentication operations
- Token-based authentication with proper expiration handling
- CSRF protection built into Firebase Authentication

### Best Practices Implemented
- Authentication state properly managed in React context
- User sessions terminated after extended inactivity
- Login attempts limited to prevent brute force attacks
- Password reset flow with secure email delivery
- Clear error messages without revealing system details

## Data Security

### Firestore Security Rules
All data access is governed by Firebase Security Rules that enforce:
- Authentication requirement for all data operations
- User-specific data isolation (users can only access their own data)
- Field-level validation to prevent malicious data insertion
- Write validation to ensure data integrity
- Admin-only access for sensitive operations

Example rule implementation:
```
match /users/{userId} {
  // Users can only read and write their own data
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

match /actors/{actorId} {
  // Only allow reading if authenticated and is owner
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
              resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Only allow creation if authenticated and setting themselves as owner
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
                request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

### Storage Security Rules
Firebase Storage security rules enforce:
- User-specific access control
- File type verification (images only)
- File size limitations
- User quota management

### Data Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- HTML content is stripped from user inputs
- Firestore security rules act as a second layer of validation
- Backend validation in Firebase Functions

## API Security

### Hugging Face API Integration
- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- Server-side proxy for AI model requests
- Request validation before API calls
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Firebase Functions
- Authentication required for sensitive operations
- Request validation and sanitization
- Error handling without exposing system details
- Rate limiting for abuse prevention

## Frontend Security

### React Security Measures
- React's built-in XSS protection
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Proper handling of user-generated content
- Secure form implementation with CSRF protection

### Third-Party Libraries
- Regular security audits using `npm audit`
- Dependency version pinning for stability
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Manual review of critical dependencies

## Deployment Security

### Vercel Configuration
- HTTPS enforcement
- HTTP security headers:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Content-Security-Policy: properly configured
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Permissions-Policy: properly restricted

### CI/CD Security
- Secrets management in GitHub Actions
- Security scans during build process
- Environment isolation
- Approval process for production deployments

## Data Privacy

### Privacy Measures
- Explicit user consent for data collection
- Clear privacy policy
- Data minimization principles applied
- User data deletion functionality

### User Control
- Account deletion option
- Data export capability
- Transparent data usage
- Clear consent management

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for security-critical functions
- Integration tests for authentication flows
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Dependency security audits

### Manual Security Testing
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) testing
- CSRF testing
- API endpoint security validation
- SQL injection testing (although using NoSQL database)
- Authorization testing

## Security Monitoring

### Error Logging
- Firebase Crashlytics integration
- Anomaly detection for authentication failures
- API abuse monitoring
- Security event logging

### Incident Response
- Defined security incident response plan
- Contact information for security issues
- Regular security review process
- Vulnerability disclosure policy

## Compliance

The application is designed with consideration for:
- GDPR compliance (for European users)
- CCPA compliance (for California users)
- General data protection best practices

## Security Updates and Maintenance

### Regular Security Activities
- Dependency updates scheduled bi-weekly
- Security patches applied promptly
- Regular security rule reviews
- Quarterly comprehensive security audit

### Security Documentation
- Security documentation maintained alongside code
- Clear comments on security-sensitive code
- Security considerations in pull request templates
- Developer security guidelines

## Data Retention and Deletion Policies

### User Account Data
- **Retention period**: For the lifetime of the user account
- **Deletion trigger**: Account deletion request or 2 years of inactivity
- **Deletion method**: Secure deletion from Firestore and Storage
- **Data backup**: 30-day retention for recovery purposes

### Generated Images
- **Retention period**: 90 days from creation, unless explicitly saved by user
- **Deletion trigger**: Automatic expiration, user deletion, or account removal
- **Deletion method**: Secure deletion from Storage with metadata cleanup
- **Quotas**: Free tier users limited to 50 saved images

### Upload Original Images
- **Retention period**: For the lifetime of the associated actor
- **Deletion trigger**: Actor deletion, user request, or account removal
- **Processing**: Metadata stripped on upload
- **Storage**: Encrypted at rest

### Activity Logs
- **Retention period**: 30 days for normal activity, 90 days for security events
- **Anonymization**: User identifiers removed after retention period
- **Access control**: Admin-only access to raw logs
- **Purpose limitation**: Used only for debugging, security, and analytics
