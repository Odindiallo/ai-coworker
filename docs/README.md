## Overview

The AI Actor Generator is a progressive web application built with React, Firebase, and Hugging Face AI models. It allows users to:

- Upload photos to create a custom AI actor
- Train AI models on these photos
- Generate new images based on text prompts
- Manage and share generated images

The application is designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring excellent performance on all devices with particular attention to mobile users.

## Technical Architecture

The application follows a modern architecture with the following key components:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components
- **State Management**: React Context API and custom hooks
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **Serverless Functions**: Firebase Cloud Functions
- **AI Models**: Hugging Face integration
- **Deployment**: Vercel with GitHub Actions CI/CD

See [technical-architecture.md](../technical-architecture.md) for detailed information.

## Mobile-First Approach

Our application is built with a mobile-first philosophy, focusing on:

- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Efficient network usage
- Battery-aware operations
- Responsive layouts
- Offline support
- Adaptive loading based on network conditions

See [mobile-optimization-guide.md](../mobile-optimization-guide.md) for detailed implementation strategies.

## Performance Optimizations

Performance is a critical aspect of our application, with particular focus on:

- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization
- Bundle size minimization
- Caching strategies
- Network-aware loading
- Memory usage optimization

Our performance monitoring system tracks Core Web Vitals and other metrics to ensure optimal user experience.

## Security Implementation

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

- Firebase Authentication with secure password policies
- Firestore security rules for data access control
- Storage security rules for media file protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure API keys management
- Environment variable protection
- Regular dependency updates and security audits

See [security-documentation.md](./security-documentation.md) for detailed information.

## Firebase Integration

Firebase provides the backend infrastructure for our application:

- **Firestore**: Stores user data, actor information, and generation history
- **Authentication**: Handles user registration, login, and session management
- **Storage**: Stores uploaded and generated images
- **Cloud Functions**: Processes image generation requests, handles AI model training, and manages other server-side operations
- **Crashlytics**: Monitors application stability

See [firebase-integration.md](./firebase-integration.md) for setup details.

## Image Optimization

Image optimization is a critical part of our mobile-first approach:

- WebP and AVIF formats where supported
- Responsive images with srcSet and sizes
- Lazy loading for off-screen images
- Progressive loading with low-quality placeholders
- Compression before upload
- Caching strategies
- CDN integration

See [image-optimization.md](./image-optimization.md) for detailed implementation.

## User Authentication

The authentication system provides:

- Email/password authentication
- Account management
- Session persistence
- Protected routes
- Password reset functionality
- Account lockout protection

## AI Model Training

The AI model training process:

1. User uploads multiple photos of a subject
2. Photos are processed and prepared for training
3. Firebase Function initiates training on Hugging Face
4. Training status is tracked in real-time
5. Completed model is made available for image generation

## Development Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- Firebase CLI
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-actor-generator.git
   cd ai-actor-generator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing

Our testing suite includes:

- Unit tests with Jest
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Integration tests
- Mobile device testing
- Performance testing

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

The application is deployed using Vercel with GitHub Actions for CI/CD:

- Push to main branch triggers production deployment
- Pull requests create preview deployments
- Automated tests run before deployment

See [deployment-guide.md](./deployment-guide.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

## Scaling Considerations

As the application grows, there are several scaling considerations:

- Firebase free tier limits
- Storage optimization
- Database query optimization
- AI model hosting costs
- CDN for high-traffic scenarios

See [scaling-costs.md](./scaling-costs.md) for detailed analysis of scaling costs and optimization strategies.
